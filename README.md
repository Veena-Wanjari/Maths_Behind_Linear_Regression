# What is Linear Regression?

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables.

# Why is it called linear regression?

Because the model is based on the equation of a straight line, y=a+bx, where a is the y-intercept (the value of y when x=0) and b is the slope (the degree to which y increases as x increases one unit). Linear regression plots a straight line through a y vs x scatterplot.  That why it is call linear regression.

# Aim: Main aim of this project is to showcase the steps involved in Training the data with two approaches. One using Scikit Learn and other with hard coding.

## Files Included:

1) Linear Regression with Scikitlearn.ipynb

To showcase how Scikit-learn which is the most popular and robust python library is used to solve a variety of statistical problems with ease.

2) [Maths Behind Linear Regression Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-linear-regression-eaaaed2d983e): To showcase the actual maths behind the process of finding the best fit. 

3) train.csv

## Sequence of Steps in Training the data are:

* Forward Propagtaion 

* Cost Function

* Backward Propagation

* Update Parameters 


# Output:

1) The first approach is to use Scikit Learn to create our model, fit, predict our model and use regression metrics to calculate mean squarred error.

2) The second approach is to give in depth analysis of step by step procedure of forward propagtaion, cost function, backward propagation and update Parameters.
